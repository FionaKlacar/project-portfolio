# project-portfolio

I started creating a portfolio to showcase my projects. I started by following the Figma design to create a mobile version of my site. I then worked on making it responsive for tablet and desktop. 
The styling has taken a lot of time and it is still not perfect. I spent some time checking accessibility and doing browser testing this week. I still have to add images and links. I will be 
working continuously on getting the site functioning properly, while personalising it with colours and information, and checking it is accessible and meets all standards.
